  Hi there, my name is Frank Grahame Murray and I’m 39 years old. I am from
  Newark, DE, home of Newark High School and the University of Delaware. I am a
  graduate of Goucher College near Baltimore, MD with a bachelors (of arts no
  less) in Computer Science. I work as a Software Engineer for Nuance
  Communications in Durham, NC. I bought a house in Historic Mordecai in
  Raleigh, near downtown. I used to have a house in San Leandro, CA . A large
  portion of my life is spent dealing with computers and electronic gadgets. My
  other big passion in life is music, both consumption and creation. I also
  enjoy other forms of entertainment, especially movies. If you were to ask me
  what my religion was, I’d probably tell you Unitarian Universalist, although I
  attend very rarely. According to the Keirsey Sorter, I used to be an INFJ,
  although now I am consistently rating as an ISFJ. This is assuming that I am
  indeed an Introvert of course. As for politics, I am quite liberal, frequently
  vacillating between the guilt-driven democratic tax-me-to-help-the-poor and
  libertarian leave-me-alone stances.

Oh well. This is exactly what I look like, when I'm looking into a bright light, digitally flush my face of all color, and add a strange blue vortex background. And yeah, maybe my eyes aren't actually a dark erie red.
