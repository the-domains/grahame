            <description><![CDATA[<p>Hi there, my name is Frank Grahame Murray and I’m 39 years old. I am from Newark, DE, home of Newark High School and the University of Delaware. I am a graduate of Goucher College near Baltimore, MD with a bachelors (of arts no less) in Computer Science. I work as a Software Engineer for Nuance Communications in Durham, NC. I bought a house in Historic Mordecai in Raleigh, near downtown. I used to have a house in San Leandro, CA . A large portion of my life is spent dealing with computers and electronic gadgets. My other big passion in life is music, both consumption and creation. I also enjoy other forms of entertainment, especially movies. If you were to ask me what my religion was, I’d probably tell you Unitarian Universalist, although I attend very rarely. According to the Keirsey Sorter, I used to be an INFJ, although now I am consistently rating as an ISFJ. This is assuming that I am indeed an Introvert of course. As for politics, I am quite liberal, frequently vacillating between the guilt-driven democratic tax-me-to-help-the-poor and libertarian leave-me-alone stances. </p>]]></description>
